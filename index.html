		My son left for college a few weeks ago, and I sent him the Chocolate Heaven gift package as a surprise. He loved it! He said it had the perfect treats to share with his roommates.

		I haven't been able to visit my sister since COVID-19 began and I'd really been missing her. I wanted to show her that I was thinking about her, so I sent her the Self-Care package. She works so hard and deserves time for herself! She said she loved the assortment of goodies and it inspired her to send a care packages to her friends.

		My girlfriend and I have been doing long distance for the past couple months and she's a huge fan of beauty and skin-care so I sent her the Beauty Box as a Valentine's Day gift. She said it had all the perfect products, so thank you Sara's Care Packages!
